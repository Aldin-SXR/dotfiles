# A collection of some of my .dotfiles

This is a collection of several .dotfiles I use in my configurations. For now, I have `.vimrc` (Vim) and `.tmux.conf` (tmux).

In order to install these configurations, just copy the files to their respective locations on the system.

- .vimrc: `~/.vimrc`
- .tmux.conf: `~/.tmux.conf`

My Vim configuration uses __Vundle__ as the plugin manager, and __vim-airline__ themes (which will require a 256-color compliant font).
Tmux uses the [tomorrow](https://github.com/edouard-lopez/tmux-tomorrow/) theme.


Feel free to suggest updates or ask about configurations.
